<h1 align="center">Browser blinking Issue in Arch Linux VM</h1>
</br>
</br>
<p>Hello all, <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></p>
</br>
<p>since a few weeks I have a strange phenomenon with my Arch Linux VM running in VMware Workstation. This is noticeable in the sense that when working in the browser, another previously opened tab often "blinks" on top of it... I hope this is understandable, otherwise here are some screenshots of the problem, my used browsers and the VM settings.</p>

I would be very happy if someone here could help me, maybe someone already had this problem? Unfortunately I am at a loss.

I have already tried the following:

- update all applications and packages
- reinstallation of vmware-tools
