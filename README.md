<h1 align="center">Browser blinking Issue in Arch Linux VM</h1>
</br>
</br>
<p>Hello all, <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></p>
</br>
<p>since a few weeks I have a strange phenomenon with my Arch Linux VM running in VMware Workstation.</br>
This is noticeable in the sense that when working in the browser, another previously opened tab often "blinks" on top of it...</br>
I hope this is understandable, otherwise here are some screenshots of the problem, my used browsers and the VM settings.</p>

I would be very happy if someone here could help me, maybe someone already had this problem? Unfortunately I am at a loss.
I have already tried the following;

- update all applications and packages
- reinstallation of vmware-tools

</br>
<p>I would be very grateful for any suggestions, please post in the <a href="https://github.com/Davokin/Browser-blinking-Issue/discussions">discussions</a></p>

</br>
Many thanks in advance
Kind regards, Davokin
